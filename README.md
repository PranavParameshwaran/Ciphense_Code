# Ciphense_Code
## 1. Problem Task 
I chose the Task 1 of the Challenge given.
## Object Detection 
I used ImageAI Library which contained pre-trained models for Object Detection. The Model which i used was ResNet.
### NOTE : I was not able to upload the pre-trained weights in GitHub as there was a limit of 25MB.
So I just uploaded the Python Script 'init.py' which runs a Flask Server and also does the Object Detection and returns the json file to Postman.
